# Contributing to Paleta

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Paleta.

Our goal is to build fast, reliable, and trouble-free open-source Python projects for all communities. We love your input and want to make every contribution transparent and effortless.

Please note that we have a Code of Conduct and expect respectful communication in all project interactions.

## Ways to Contribute

You can help by:

- reporting a bug,
- discussing the current state of the code,
- submitting a fix,
- proposing new features,
- becoming a maintainer.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to:

- host the code,
- track issues and feature requests,
- review and accept pull requests.

## GitHub Flow

All code changes happen through Pull Requests.

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your PRs:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you changed APIs, update documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Open a Pull Request.
7. Always add a `README` and/or `requirements.txt` to added code when relevant.

## Contribution License

Any contribution you make is understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project.

In short, by submitting code changes, you agree that your submissions are licensed under MIT.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs.

Please open a new issue and include enough detail so maintainers can reproduce and fix the problem quickly.

### Good Bug Reports Usually Include

- A quick summary and context.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Specific details and sample code (if possible).
- What you expected to happen.
- What actually happened.
- Notes (for example what you already tried).

## Coding Style

Use a consistent coding style and follow good Python practices.

- Prefer readable, maintainable code.
- Follow PEP 8 where possible.
- Run lint checks before opening a PR (for example `flake8`).
